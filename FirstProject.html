                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Molly’s is a multi-level neighborhood bar that marries a legendary and historic space with the contemporary atmosphere of a comfortable gathering space and corner bar.

				In Chicago, the corner tavern was a staple of ethnic neighborhoods for years.  It was a social center and a gathering place for the community. Neighbors celebrated holidays, discussed politics and relaxed after a day’s work.

				Today, the corner bar in the middle of a gentrified neighborhood is a rare breed.  Molly’s has survived all these years by being a good neighbor and forging a sense of community, comfort and good times. Our mission is to continue to provide our guests with a truly personal experience in a unique and fun environment. Our greatest compliment comes from our customers that say coming to Molly’s makes them feel like they’re coming home.</p>
