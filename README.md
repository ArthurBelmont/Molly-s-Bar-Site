>The Molly's Bar
---

This site was inspired by Chicago fire, a Fire Department series, in which 3 firefighters bought a bar after answering a call and putting out the fire in it. 
The bar is called Molly's.
My goal on this site is to learn a little more about html and css, in the future include JS, PHP etc.

##Using

To link a .css file to a .html document, we must insert a <link> tag in the <head> of the document, with the file path href
>I used this code to reference the css with the html

'link rel = "stylesheet" href = "css / style.css"'
